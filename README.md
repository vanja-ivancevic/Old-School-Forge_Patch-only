# [DEPRECATED] Old-School Shandalar Forge Patch

> **Important Notice:** This patch repository is deprecated and will no longer be updated.
>
> Please use the full fork of Forge instead: [Forge: Old-School Shandalar Edition](https://github.com/vanja-ivancevic/forge-old-school-shandalar)

## Why the Change?

Instead of providing a patch to be applied to the original Forge, I've now created a complete fork of the Forge engine with all the Old-School Shandalar modifications already integrated. This approach offers:

- Better code integration and stability
- Easier installation (no patching required)
- Improved maintenance and updates
- Core code fixes that couldn't be implemented via simple patches

## What's in the Full Fork?

The full fork includes all the modifications from this patch and more:

- Card restrictions to only allow old-border sets (Alpha through Scourge)
- Completely reimagined enemy decks for an authentic old-school experience
- Adjusted shop inventories and rewards
- Core code fixes for proper handling of reprinted cards
- A complete standalone game experience

## How to Switch

Simply download and use the full fork from the link above and follow the installation instructions provided in that repository.
